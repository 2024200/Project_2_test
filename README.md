### Description

There are two goals with this project;

1) To develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts bank customer churn based on the features provided.

2) To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) that allows stakeholders to explore and understand customer data, identifying key patterns and insights related to churn behavior.
